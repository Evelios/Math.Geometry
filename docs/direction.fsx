# Direction 2D

A direction can be though of as a normalized vector or can be though of just something pointing in a particular
direction on the 2D cartesian plane. When looking at the type of a direction, you can notice that it doesn't have any
unit type, `Direction2D<'Coordinates>`. This is because a direction _always_ has a magnitude of 1 and doesn't need any
unit qualifier.

(** # Builders *)

(**
`Direction2D.xy` first checks to make sure that the input components are both non-zero, then normalizes them to
guarantee a valid direction is created.

Direction2D.xy 3. 4.
(***hide***)
Direction2D.xy 3. 4.
|> Option.map Direction2D.toTuple
(*** include-it ***)

(**
When both values are zero, a proper direction cannot be created, so the program returns a `None` option.
(Appears as `<null>` in the terminal)

Direction2D.xy 0. 0.
(*** hide ***)
Direction2D.xy 0. 0.
|> Option.map Direction2D.toTuple
(*** include-it ***)

(**
You can also create a direction using similar functionality to `Direction2D.xy` but with _tuples_ as an input instead.
